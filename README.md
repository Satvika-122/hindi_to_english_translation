# hindi_to_english_translation

The Hindi-to-English Translation Project translates Hindi text into English, aiding education, business, and cultural exchange. Built using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models with LSTM networks, it processes bilingual datasets for effective translation. This approach ensures context-aware translations, saves time, fosters inclusivity, and bridges language gaps across diverse fields efficiently and accurately.
